        <h3>Square Dance</h3>
        <p>... Because I'm terrible at art.<br/>
        A game made for <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dare 31.</a><br/>
        It's kind of reminiscent of old arcadey flash games.<br/>
        Move mouse to move character, left click to dash/attack, right click for bomb when your meter is full. Hit 'm' to mute the music.<br/>
        Credit goes to Craftyjs,for the game framework, and Ableton for the samples in the music.
